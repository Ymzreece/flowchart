# Flowchart Prompt Template

Copy your source code or project description below. The generator script will send this entire file to the LLM (plus its own schema instructions) and expect a JSON graph of nodes and edges, so keep it concise and focused on the logic you want explained.

## Optional guidance for the model
- Call out every menu option or branch explicitly in the narrative so that the downstream flowchart can model them.
- Describe what triggers each transition (e.g., which key press or condition) in natural language.
- Explain loops or background tasks step by step so each phase of the cycle is clear.
- Use descriptive summaries so non-developers understand the intent of each step.
